    "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) ([PLoS: Protein–Protein Interactions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2891586/)) refer to specific functional or physical contact between proteins in vivo. Interactions may be dependent on biological context, organism, definition of interaction, and many other factors. An example of PPIs can be seen below.\n",

A PPI network can be modelled via a graph in which the nodes represent the proteins and the edges represent interactions: an edge from node A to node B indicates protein B interacts with protein A. The diagram above shows the PPI network centred around the protein $mazG$ in *Escherichia coli K12 MG1655*. This is part of a toxin-antitoxin system. These systems generally encode pairs of *toxin* and inhibitory *antitoxin* proteins, are transmitted by plasmids, and likely serve several biological functions including stress tolerance and genome stabilisation. $mazG$ regulates the type II toxin-antitoxin system shown in this network, where $mazF$ is the toxin and $mazE$ is the antitoxin. More details on the proteins in this network can be seen on STRING-DB ([STRING-DB: mazG in E. coli](https://version-11-0b.string-db.org/cgi/network?networkId=b6lw5pU2DeQm).\n",

    "\n",
    "* Using pen and paper, draw a diagram of the PPI network.\n",
    "* Decide on the ordering of the nodes. I chose to start with the centre node, and then number them in an anticlockwise direction.  (**Hint:** There are 11 nodes in total.)\n",
    "* Label your pen and paper diagram with the node numbers.\n",
    "* Work out all the edges in the graph. Note the numbers of the node at the start of the edge and the node at the end of the edge. (**Hint:** There are 20 edges in total.)\n",
    "* Define a $11 \\times 11$ matrix in Python using the Numpy `zeros` function.\n",
    "* For each edge, set the corresponding entry in the matrix to 1 (start node number corresponds to row number and end node number corresponds to column number in the adjacency matrix).\n",
    "* Define a cell array containing your node names and create a NetworkX object.\n",
    "* Experiment with the layout, colours, node shapes etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to use the Python documentation, e.g. using `help()` if you have problems (or alternatively use a search engine such as Google).\n",
