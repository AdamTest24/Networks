This speeds up the creation of a network matrix with only a few non-zero entries. Similarly, one can start with function `ones` from Numpy to create a network with few zero entries.\n",

    "The __clustering coefficient__, here denoted by $C_u$, is a number that is calculated for a single node, $u$. For the calculation one needs to know the degree of the node, $k$. The degree represents the number of direct connections of the node. Nodes connected by an edge are referred to as nearest neighbours, or simply neighbours. Therefore, the degree is also equal to the number of neighbours. Finally, $e$ is the number of edges (connections) between the neighbours of $u$.\n",
