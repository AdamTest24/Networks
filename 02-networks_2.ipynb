Some biological networks seem to have the so-called ['small world' property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network), where in spite of relatively few connections there are quick ways to get from one node to any other node by tracing a path along combinations of edges.\n",

The degree represents the number of direct connections of the node. Nodes connected by an edge are referred to as nearest neighbours, or simply neighbours. Therefore, the degree is also equal to the number of neighbours. Finally, $e$ is the number of edges (connections) between the neighbours of $u$.\n",
